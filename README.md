This is Teagan Stewart's solo implementation of my Assignment Two SWEN325 App in React Native. Originally was in a group, but we decided to work solo.

Download my project
Place it into a minimal ionic react project
Navigate to the project location in command line
Run The following commands:     <br/>  
$ npm install react-native-paho-mqtt <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation-stack <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation-tabs <br/>
$ npm install @react-native-community/masked-view <br/>
$ npm install react-native-paper <br/>
$ npm install react-native-reanimated <br/>
$ npm install react-native-vector-icons <br/>
$ npm install react-native-gesture-handler <br/>
$ npm install @capacitor/core <br/>
$ npm i react-push-notification <br/>
$ npm install react-native-chart-kit <br/>
$ npm install react-native-svg <br/>
<br/>
The app should be running.
